# Notes
- `Step motor 1` is used for mixing and `Step motor 2` is used for lifting and lowering the container.
- `HC-05` is connected directly to the serial communications ports of the Arduino. Uploading code into the Arduino will fail when HC-05 is connected.
- `DS18B20` has a slow refresh rate, so code code slows down when it's activated.
- `Load cell`, `Pump` and `Temperature` devices are calibrated. However, it's recommended to re-calibrate them.
- Code can run without calibration equations.
- Start position of `Step motor 2` is defined as the position it's in when the Arduino turns on or resets.



# Commands
Data is received like an 5-bit `int` data type value. The first 2 bits, known as dataCode, define the function to execute. Last 3 bits, known as dataValue, define the input value when needed (only for functions 10, 20 and 30). 

- **10**: Load cell calibration. Receives `KNOWN_WEIGHT` as `dataValue` to calibrate.
- **11**: Load cell tares 100 times.
- **20**: Pump turns on with a 125 PWM and defines reference weight as `dataValue`. Up to this value the system will pump water, when weight gets to that reference point pumping will stop. 
- **21**: Turns pump off.
- **30**: Step motor 1 receives mixing value for PWM as `dataValue`.
- **31**: Turns step motor 1 off.
- **40**: Lifts down container.
- **41**: Lifts up container.
- **99**: Stops everything and returns height to start position.
